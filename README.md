# Car Customizer

It's a simple application to simulate car customization by selecting car model, engine, gearbox and color. All styling has been kept in 80's style ;) 

**Important: this app will work only with backend application, which has to be cloned and ran on your computer. You can find it [here](https://github.com/vveronika/car-customizer-backend).**

For now missing things are: tests and errors handling (like some toasts if backend app would crush or sth).

To run the client application (after cloning it on your computer and running backend application), in the project directory:

**npm install**
will install all required dependencies, and

**npm start**
will run the app. It should run on port 3000. 

**The most important libraries and tools I used in this project:**
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
 - [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
 - [Redux (thunk)](https://redux.js.org/)
 - [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)
